1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,050
Lizzie: It is truth universally acknowledged that a single man

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,460
in possession of a good fortune

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,900
must be in want of a wife.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,200
My mom gave each of us one of these last Christmas.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,900
I have yet to wear it...

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,700
…ever.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,600
Who am I? I'm a 24 year old grad student with
a mountain of student loans,

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,700
living at home and preparing for a career.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,700
But to my mom, the only thing that matters is that I'm single.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,400
My name is Lizzie Bennet and this is my life.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,100
"My Name is Lizzie Bennet"
Written by Bernie Su

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,500
So my Mom belongs to a class of parents
I like to call the 2.5 WPF Club.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,699
What's the 2.5 WPF Club? It stands for a home with 2.5 kids

14
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:41,700
and a white picket fence.
Which I know actually sounds pretty nice.

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,600
But it's really annoying when it's all your mom talks about 24/7.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Not only is my mom a member of the 2.5 WPF club,
she's probably the president.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,200
How do I know? Ladies and the gentlemen, I present again…
Exhibit A.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,000
Universal Truth, really?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,500
I'm sure there are a great number of rich, young,
single men who aren't looking for wives.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,600
In fact, let's examine the percentages.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,200
Sleezeballs and scumbags,

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,000
Incapable of escaping current dead-end relationships,

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,100
sailing around the world trying to find themselves,

24
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,500
focusing on work, or skills, or hobbies, or whatever it is
that rich guys do when they're young.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,650
But no. According to mother, every rich, single guy is
put on this planet to impregnate her daughters.

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,550
To illustrate my point, I'll need a little help.

27
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,100
Charlotte: What are you doing?

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,980
Lizzie: This is my friend Charlotte, and
she's going to help me with this demo.

29
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,650
Charlotte: No I'm not. What is this from?
Lizzie: Here, okay, your lines.

30
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,600
Charlotte: Who wrote this?
Lizzie: Shakespeare.

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,150
Honey! did you hear the house in
Netherfield sold the other day?

32
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,100
Charlotte: Did it now?
Lizzie: The large mansion with the white picket fence and

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,750
plenty of space to raise 2.5 grandkids.
Charlotte: Mmmhmm

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:50,200
Lizzie: Emily Lu told me. She said the deal was for three million
dollars! But it's not the price that matters, but who bought it.

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Charlotte: As you say, my dear.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,369
Lizzie: He's a well-mannered young man
from Harvard, working to become a doctor.

37
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,500
I hear his family has quite the fortune. How perfect for our girls!

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,100
Charlotte: How so?

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,050
Lizzie: Oh my dear husband! Can't you
imagine him with one of our daughters?

40
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,400
Charlotte: I find that rather difficult,
since I have yet to meet this young man.

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,049
Lizzie: Then you must go meet him at once!
Welcome him to the neighborhood.

42
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:23,000
I will bake a pie. Let him know about our three eligible
young daughters who are in desperate need of a rich, single man.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,700
Look, I'm all for rich, single guys, but who
is my mom to tell one of us who to marry?

44
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,500
What if he's gay? What if he's a serial killer?
What if he's a gay serial killer?

45
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,000
I've got other things to worry about.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's not like we're all going to put our lives on hold because some rich single guy dropped from the sky.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,300
Lydia: Lizzie! Did mom tell you about who just
bought that mansion in Netherfield?

48
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,750
Lizzie: Haven't heard a word about it.

49
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,700
Lydia: So this... wait. What are you guys doing?

50
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,599
Lizzie: Making a video.

51
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,139
Everyone this is my sister, Lydia.

52
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:58,000
Lydia: Anyway, so this guy, his name is Bing Lee,
and he is rich, hot, annndd...

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,650
Lizzie: Let me guess... single?

54
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:05,919
Lydia: Jackpot, right?!? Whaaaat!
Lizzie: No.

55
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,000
Lydia: Whaaaaat. Yesss.
